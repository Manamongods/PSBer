It's not perfect, but definitely better than doing it manually

You just need to create a PSBer asset in Create/Custom 2D/PSBer
You only need one PSBer for an entire folder hierarchy
Then every time you make a modification to your .psd file(s), you can click the "refresher" bool on the asset and it will copy the files to .psb files. If "Constantly Update" is true, then it will do this automatically.
